# First Saturday

This lab to be done over the first weekend. 
Overall idea is to read the code, read the tests, and then write some code to pass all the tests.

Be sure to commit all your changes multiple times as you're working on the lab.

`git commit -m "checkpointing my work"` should do, be sure to change the message to something meaningful to the work you're saving.

When you are finished, and are passing all the tests, be sure to do a final `git commit` and `git push`.

now see [README.TXT](README.TXT).
